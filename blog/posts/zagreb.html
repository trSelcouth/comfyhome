        Zagreb. The capital of Croatia, where this story began, ended, and every other started.
        A city of a thousand hoods, kept afloat by students, taxed by the local football club, monetized by the gypsies and drowned in the Sava.
        Through it's long history, it had produced a few greats and a great many lessers, some reaching for the stars, but most shooting for their neighbour.
        It began as two cities; "Lower Zagreb", at the foot of the mountain Zagreb, and the other, on top of the Zagreb river bank, named "Upper Zagreb".
        A hypothetical observer would quickly notice this naming made little to no sense at all, as "Upper Zagreb" was indeed below "Lower Zagreb"
        by all geographical and linguistic standards. However, due to the innate Crotian ability to ignore the existances of any opposing villages so hard
        as to render them physically invisible to the viewer, the people of Zagreb took no account of the worries of our hypothetical observer.

        And so it was, that for 500 years the two Zagrebs grew ignorantly, guided towards each other by the gentle hands of the river and the mountain,
        until finally, they met in the middle. Not only did this mean that one had to acknowledge the existance of a new half of an entire city, and
        quickly figure out their stereotypes so as to insult them better, but the afformentioned geographically-linguistic reality of the whole situation
        just began to sink in. Much like giving red wine to a bride; chaos ensued, a war quickly broke out. Each district proclaimed itself an independent
        city, and the line inbetween became a no-man's-land.
        Each side wanted to be the new "upper" Zagreb, because it felt like the right thing to want, and the only think men from each side agreed on was
        that the whole affair could be summed up by saying "our way or no way" and nodding encouragingly ("ili" being the croatian word for "or" and
        with this phrase as their prominent feature for thousands of years, people from this region rightfully earned their name - "Iliri").
        This went on for a few years, mostly a formality in the later months, until one small, chubby, moustachioed man came out into the unkept, holey 
        middle of the trench, wielding a half-empty bottle of cherry brandy, and screaming incoherently at both sides while clumsily trying to brandish his saber.
        This ordeal went on for a while and succeeded in drawing the attetion of most present just in time to witness the proud appearance of one
        elderly saber. </p>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        "Riiiiiiiiiiiight", the moustaches spoke, "what if we just.... eeehhh...".
      </p>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        A drink, to keep his thoughts on track.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        "become ONE citeehh... an-buggerrr...", he wobbled as he almost tripped over one of the piles of bricks
      </p>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        "one city and... we both keep the motto... bechaushwe it's thew shamewyneanywy...", he started doozing off, but then tripped again and regained
      </p>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        himself, "and we... build a nice BIG street here!", he finished, angrily pointing his saber at the ground.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">
        Ordinarily, this wouldn't come even close to uniting opposing sides of stubborness that are Iliri, but as luck would have it, at that moment everyone
        was, if only slightly, frustrated by something else more than the upper/lower squabbles, and simply because it made things easier, the people agreed.
        And so, they banded the two cities into one, decided that only one thing should be named "Zagreb", to avoid confusion, and somehow the big bundle of houses
        between the mountain and the river, peopled by a society whose each member considered themselves as "Zagrebcani", seemed like the best fit.
        The mountain was then named "Medvednica", because "medved" is croatian for "bear", and the mountain hosted several families them, while the river
        was named "Sava", because the man living closest to it had thought it sounded good.

        So as to bring the people together, one very avant-grade chef had made a meal consisting of duck meat, as it was the most abundant, and mlinci, a
        simple sort of pasta popular in homes underneath the mountain. And so "patka i mlinci" was made, a dish to unite the population. Once the tensions between the
        people were drowned in duck sauce, the city became productive, and money started pouring in. Josip Jelačić, the drunken fellow who united the city through
        sheer drunken luck, was made Ban (a type of ruler, because "king" and "dodge" were already taken by Vienna and Venice respectively, and "emperor" sounded
        too formal), and he made a long and wonderful street where the no-mans-land once was, and he called it "Ilica", so as to never forget the dispute that divided
        them.

        As catholicism was the trend at the time, the people of Zagreb also comissioned a cathedral, to commemorate their god and bring further unision between the people.
        Sadly, a local gypsy crone cursed the building, never to be completed, which is to this day reflected in Zagreb's coat of arms - a citadel with three towers (the original
        request was, of course, a catherdral with two towers, but the local artist which had designed the coat of arms was not very good with numbers, or words for that matter),
        arched by a sun and a moon, signifying the two towers of the cathedral - the left, forever keeping a woke eye to the right one, deep in slumber beneath a renovation
        blanket for all eternity.
