        <p class="blog-paragraph">He was rushing down to the /STREET-NAME/, books almost falling out of his hands. If he didn't hurry, he'd be
          late for class, and the uni in Zurich did not approve of slackers. He'd be kicked out, and his name stained. He reached the /banhoff-station/
          just in time to leap into the last wagon of line /LINE-NUMBER/. A seat in the middle was empty, so he relaxed for a while. Only 3 stations to
          central ETH building, and he'd be running the second he got out. If the gods dared to smile, he could still make it in the nick of time.

          As he was getting back to his senses, the tram was driving by the shore of /LAKE-NAME/ and he stared into its unyielding darkness. 
          This was his third year in Zurich, and he had come to consider the lake his closest friend. At least, he concluded by the end of his first year,
          it didn't even try to hide its coldness.

          Ah, we're reaching the /bridge-name/, he thought, and smiled. The sensation of the tram driving over the /bridge-name/, and the view of the
          unapologetic lake had always succeeded in keeping him sane. The romance and tranquilty of it, spoke in a gentle whisper only he seemed to hear.
          His beloved scenery was shattered as an uninvited figure entered and sat across him.
